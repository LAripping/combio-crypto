- file3-73415.txt.enc:  The encrypted file given
- decrypted.txt:        The decrypted contents of the given file
- keyfile.txt:          The keyfile in the format requested (1 ASCII code per line)
- solution.py:          A script that demonstrates the above in a single clean run
- monoalpha.py:         The code used to assist the statistical analysis process 
                        with handful methods and workarounds to visualize the 
                        unprintable characters while trying to decrypt them 
- buildup.txt:          A screen captured depicting a part of the process followed
                        to slowly build the 'key' and achieve a meaningful decryption
